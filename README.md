**Customer Reviews:**
---------------------

“Illuderma legit transformed my skin. I had moderate to severe hormonal combination skin acne a couple of years ago. I had no hope for skincare, and most topical creams weren’t doing it for me. Then, I decided to try Illuderma. After a week of using it, my skin went from dry and flaky to silky smooth. I even noticed it started fading my wrinkles so I’ll keep using it until they completely disappear!”

“I mean wow. I love this product. I applied this for the first time at night right after cleansing, I put an even layer on my post acne scars and then went to sleep. I woke up and my skin was brighter, my pores were smaller and the texture and color in my skin was noticeably better. Second night, the same results, only even better. Two weeks later, what scars? Pores? Never heard of them! Omg I just love it!!!”
